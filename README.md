## Project Description ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Mandatory%3A-Yes-red.svg)


Small discription of the project. Some text copied from IDNET project folder for instance.

### GIT Structure
All projects are organized with the following structure:
- Hardware;
- Firmware;
- Software;
- Management;
- Research;

The first three folders should contain the files for each workgroup. In the case of hardware, for example schematic files for pcb boards or up to the datasheet of all modules used. For firmware and software the respective codes should be collated and in the section below how to execute or compile them.
In the folder management can be found everything that concerns the management of the project as well as the list of necessary material.
Finally in the folder Reserach can be collucado some document that was important in the development of the project.
